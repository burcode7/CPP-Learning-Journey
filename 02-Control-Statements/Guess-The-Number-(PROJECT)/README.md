# Guess the Number (PROJECT)
- The computer will randomly select an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
    - The user will try and guess the computer's number
    - You must also count the number of guesses
- Four possibilities:
    - If the user guesses correctly, print 
   
       ```Congragulations! You guessed the number in **# of guesses**! Thanks for playing```
    
        and the program exits.
    - If the user selects a number too low, print out

        ```Your guess is too low!```
    
    - If the use selects a number too high, print out 

        ``` Your guess is too high!```

    - If the user selects a number lower than 1 or higher than 100, tell the user that it was a wasted guess and to pick between 1 and 100
