## Control Statements
- Flow of control (Control flow)
    - The order in which instructions are executed

- Special syntax is used to change the normal (sequential) flow of control throughout the program

- Three primary categories of control statements
    - Sequential statements (sequence statements)
    - Selection statements (decision statements)
    - Repetition statements (loops)

- Three specific selection control statements
    - if
    - if-else
    - switch

- Use conditions to determine what is executed
    - EG: 
    ```c++
    if (5 > 10) 
    {
        cout << "math";
    }
    ```
